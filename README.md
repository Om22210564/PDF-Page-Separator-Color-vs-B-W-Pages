📄 PDF Page Separator: Color vs B&W Pages
A simple tool to separate pages of a PDF into two files:
✔ Black & White PDF – Pages with only text.
✔ Color PDF – Pages containing images.

This helps reduce printing costs by ensuring that only necessary pages are printed in color.
Problem:
Printing a full book PDF is expensive because pages with images must be printed in color, while text-only pages can be black & white. Manually separating these pages is slow and impractical.

Solution:
My application automatically analyzes a PDF and splits it into two PDFs:
Black & White PDF → Pages containing only text
Color PDF → Pages containing images, diagrams, or photos

This saves money and time when printing large PDFs.

🚀 Features
✅ Automatically classifies pages as text-only or image-containing.
✅ Generates two separate PDFs: one for color pages, one for text-only pages.
✅ User-friendly Streamlit UI for easy upload, processing, and download.
